# ‚òÇÔ∏è App Proxy

App-proxy is a transparent HTTP proxy to add authentication to Umbrel apps. Every HTTP request and Websocket connection goes through the proxy and each request has the session token checked for validity. The session token is set via [App-auth](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel/tree/master/deps/app-auth). It runs by-default as a containerized service.

## üöÄ Getting started

If you are looking to run Umbrel on your hardware, you do not need to run this service on it's own. Just download [Umbrel OS](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os/releases) and you're good to go.

## üõ† Running app-proxy

Make sure [`umbrel-manager`](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-manager) and [`app-auth`](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel/tree/master/deps/app-auth) are running and available.

### Development and testing
```sh
cd $UMBREL_ROOT/deps/app-proxy/test
./test.sh docker-compose.app1.yml
```

Within the `test` directory there are several test apps to test different functionality such as Websocket and SSE with the proxy. 

### Environment variables (dev/testing)

| `APP_HOST` | App's frontend container hostname/IP |  |
| `APP_PORT` | App's frontend container port |  |
| `APP_MANIFEST_FILE` | Location of app's manifest file | `/extra/umbrel-app.yml` |
| `UMBREL_AUTH_PORT` | App-auth's exposed (port-forwarded) port | `2000` |
